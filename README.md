# HelpText App

This is a project testing Angular 2 with Electron.  The idea is to serve and drop an excel document to be parsed for display and download in different formats.

# Frameworks

This project is using Electron to run this app from the desktop.

Electron is allowing the webframework to work as a desktop app and work with the users filesystem to serve, save and take files from the user directly to their desktop.

Angular 2 is being used to quickly render a repetitive series of dynamic componenets rendered depending on the file that the user customizes and drops into the app.
